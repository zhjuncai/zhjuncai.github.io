Hello World!

Hello Everybody, this is the first blog I wrote. It's hosted on github and uses jekyll without any theme yet.
I couldn't find a free theme that I like, maybe later I will create my own from scratch, let's see.

Because I'm a `developer` so be expected that my blog includes all technical stuff and programming language trick and tips.

{% highlight swift %}
func sayHelloTo(name: String){
	print("Hello \(name)")
}
sayHelloTo("Ethan")
#=> prints 'Hello Ethan' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
